# YOLOv8-visdrone
We proposed a improved yolov8n models, which combines the localwindowattention and DynamicConv module, it outperforms the yolov8n models 1.9%(32.9%) in Visdrone, while still maintains compatible reasoning speed(100 FPS).

Download the ultralytics and register the modules.

localwindowattention.py and C2f_DynamicConv.py are blocks that improves the capability of YOLOv8n models.
